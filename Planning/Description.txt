Usage Case for MasterMind

Playing against the machine


User opens the game. The game will prompt user whether they would like to be the codeBreaker, or the codeMaker. (The latter would play against an AI.).

codeBreaker: 
	Computer will randomly generate a code*. The user will be given a choice of 8 colors** to choose from
	to enter a 4 color length code. once the code has been entered, the computer will check against it's own code, and return 1 black peg for every color 
	in the appropriate slot, and 1 white peg for every color that matches but is not in the correct slot. That will be printed on screen, and the next 
	turn will begin, displaying the history***, and awaiting the next turn. if the player receives 4 black pegs (AKA they guess the exact code), the player
	wins, displaying the Victory text, and ending the game.	if the game reaches to 12 turns, the player loses the game, ending it. At the end of the game,
	user receives option to play again, return to main menu, or exit the game.
	
codeMaker: 
	Computer will ask the player to enter a 4 color code. Once player has entered the code, the AI will loop taking a turn, waiting 2 seconds, and repeating
	until the end of the game is reached. and display the game's History, and the player's code, if successful.
